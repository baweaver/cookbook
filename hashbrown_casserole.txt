Hashbrown Casserole
===================

30 oz. bag shredded potatoes
1 c. sour cream
1 c. sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 medium sweet onion, chopped
1/4 c. butter, melted

Mix all ingredients (you will probably have some potatoes left over) and pour
into an 8"x8" pan. Top with a little extra cheese and bake at 350F for 30
minutes, or until exposed potatoes are golden and crispy. Serves 4-6; for a
larger group, double the recipe and use a 9"x13" pan.
