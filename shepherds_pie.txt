(adapted from a foodnetwork.com recipe)
1 lb. ground beef, 80-85% lean
1 medium onion, diced
1 large can sliced mushrooms (8 oz. dry weight)
garlic powder to taste (~1 tsp.)
1 12 oz. can cream of mushroom soup
1 lb. package frozen veggies (green beans, carrots & corn medley works well)
4 cups (or 6 servings) of mashed potatoes
grated parmesan cheese
italian seasoning

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In large skillet, sautee diced onion and ground beef. Add mushrooms (do not
drain) and simmer until onion is tender and ground beef is done. Add garlic
powder and cream of mushroom soup, mix well and simmer on low heat while
preparing potatoes.

Since instant potato flakes have directions by servings rather than cups, I
made six servings' worth (4 servings times 1.5). Pour frozen veggies into
3 quart casserole, cover with beef and mushroom mixture, and top with mashed
potatoes (use spatula to spread potatoes evenly to edges of casserole). Top
with parmesan cheese and italian seasoning. Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes,
or until potatoes are golden.
