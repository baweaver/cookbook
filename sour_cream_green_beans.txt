Sour Cream Green Beans
======================

2c (or 1lb.) cut green beans (must be fresh - NOT frozen or canned)
.25c chopped yellow onion
3T butter
2T flour
2T sugar
2t dried parsley (or 2T fresh chopped parsley)
.75c milk
2T vinegar
1c sour cream
4 slices bacon (cooked until crisp, drained and crumbled)

Cook the green beans in boiling salted water until tender, then drain and set
aside.  In a saucepan, sautee the onion in the butter until transparent, then
add in the flour, sugar, parsley and milk. Heat to a boil, then stir in the
vinegar. Reduce heat to simmer and stir in sour cream and green beans. Stir
in most of the bacon, reserving about 1 slice's worth to sprinkle over the
top as a garnish.
