.5 c. chopped pecans

1/3 c. evaporated milk per each 14 oz. pkg. caramels - 1 pkg for regular, 2
pkgs for extra, 3 pkgs for ultimate (will require freezing to be solid enough
to eat!)

Mix cake mix, 1/3 c. evaporated milk and butter. Spread half of mixture into
greased 13x9 pan and bake @ 350F 6-8 minutes or until bubbly. Meanwhile, melt
caramels (in microwave or over low heat) and stir in 1/3 c. evaporated milk
for each bag of caramels. Cool slightly. Sprinkle choc. chips over warm cake,
then pour on caramel mixture. Sprinkle w/pecans and spread remaining cake

minutes.
