0.5 c. butter, melted
17 oz. can whole kernel corn (undrained)
17 oz. can creamed corn
8.5 oz. box corn bread mix (e.g. Jiffy)
0.5 c. yellow cake mix (if desired, for sweetness)
2 eggs, beaten
1 c. sour cream
 
preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first 6 ingredients well, then fold in sour
cream gently. pour into 10 x 10 inch (9x9 may overflow) greased pan and
bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes, until firm.

if using a different pan size (e.g. 9x13, which is a good option), adjust
baking time as needed. Good hot or at room temperature. freezes/thaws well.
