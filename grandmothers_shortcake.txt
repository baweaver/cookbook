Grandmother's Strawberry Shortcake
----------------------------------
2 cups flour
3.5 tsp. baking powder
.5 tsp. salt
2 Tbsp. sugar
.5 c. butter/margarine
1 egg
2/3 c. milk

Oven: 450 F.

Sift together dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt, sugar). Cut
shortening into dry ingredients with pastry blender. Beat milk and egg
together in a separate bowl, then pour gradually into flour mixture. Stir
until soft dough is formed (will be _very_ sticky). Divide dough into two
well-greased and floured 9" round pans and smooth dough to cover bottoms of
both pans.

Bake 12-15 minues at 450 F. or until browned. Let cool for a few minutes
before slicing (6 portions per pan). Serve with strawberries (mashed with
sugar) and cream.
